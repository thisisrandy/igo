## igo-frontend

<p align="center"><img alt="igo screenshot" src="screenshot.png" /></p>

This is the frontend (user interface) code for a browser-based
[igo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>) (囲碁, go) application, which you
can play [here](https://playigo.herokuapp.com/). Note that hosting is on the
[heroku](heroku.com) [free
tier](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours), so the web server
may take a few moments to come up if it has been sleeping. It should thereafter
be responsive until there is no activity for 30 minutes, at which point it will
sleep again. The backend (game server) code is
[here](https://github.com/thisisrandy/igo-backend).

### Installation

Clone the repository and run `yarn install` from the root directory.

### Running locally

Run `yarn start` for the [react](https://reactjs.org/) development server and
`yarn build` for the production server. You will need an instance of the [game
server](https://github.com/thisisrandy/igo-backend) to be running, and
`REACT_APP_GAME_SERVER_URI` in [.env](.env) must be pointing to it. If you want
to play with other machines on the local network, change the address in
[.env](.env) to your local IP address instead of `localhost`.
